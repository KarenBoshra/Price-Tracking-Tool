## Background

The European Union (EU) serves as a significant case study, with a vast majority of individuals engaging in online activities, including purchasing goods and services. The proliferation of e-commerce within the EU underscores the importance of tools like the Price Tracking Tool, which cater to the needs of modern consumers.

According to statistics from 2023, 92% of individuals aged 16-74 in the EU used the internet within the previous year, with 75% engaging in online purchasing. The growth of e-commerce over the past decade has been substantial, with notable increases in countries like Hungary. This trend highlights the necessity for tools that streamline the online shopping experience and provide consumers with valuable insights.
